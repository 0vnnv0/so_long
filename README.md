## üìñ Description
Create a basic 2D game in which a dolphin escapes Earth after eating some fish. Instead of a dolphin, fish, and the Earth, you can use any character, any collectible, and any place you want. The project must comply with the following rules:

### üéÆ The Game

- The player‚Äôs goal is to collect every collectible present on the map, then escape choosing the shortest possible route.
- The W, A, S, and D keys must be used to move the main character.
- The player should be able to move in these 4 directions: up, down, left, right.
- The player should not be able to move into walls.
- At every move, the current number of movements must be displayed in the shell.
- You have to use a 2D view (top-down or profile).
- The game doesn‚Äôt have to be real-time.
- Although the given examples show a dolphin theme, you can create the world you want.

### üé® Graphic Management

- Your program has to display the image in a window.
- The management of your window must remain smooth (changing to another window, minimizing, and so forth).
- Pressing ESC must close the window and quit the program in a clean way.
- Clicking on the cross on the window‚Äôs frame must close the window and quit the program in a clean way.
- The use of the images of the MiniLibX is mandatory.

### üó∫Ô∏è The Map

- The map has to be constructed with 3 components: walls, collectibles, and free space.
- The map can be composed of only these 5 characters:  <br/>
&emsp; - 0 for an empty space  <br/>
&emsp; - 1 for a wall  <br/>
&emsp; - C for a collectible  <br/>
&emsp; - E for a map exit  <br/>
&emsp; - P for the player‚Äôs starting position.
- The map must contain at least 1 exit, 1 collectible, and 1 starting position.
- The map must contain only 1 starting position and 1 exit.
- The map must be rectangular.
- The map must be closed/surrounded by walls. If it‚Äôs not, the program must return an error.
- You don‚Äôt have to check if there‚Äôs a valid path in the map.
- You must be able to parse any kind of map, as long as it respects the above rules.
- If any misconfiguration of any kind is encountered in the file, the program must exit in a clean way, and return "Error\n" followed by an explicit error message of your choice.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to play

‚Ä¢ To compile the game, navigate to the files/ directory and run the following command: <br/>
```markdown
make
```
‚Ä¢ This will generate an executable named so_long. <br/>
‚Ä¢ To launch the game, use the following command: <br/>
```bash
./so_long maps/huge.ber
```
‚Ä¢ huge.ber is a map description file in the format *.ber.
